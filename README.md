# Heroes Expansion

The new Heroes 5 experience !

## Context

This mod was greatly inspired by Heroes 5.5 - thanks to Magnomagnus and Dredknight for their amazing ideas and realization.  
But this mod is made with a different spirit, it is not focused of perfect PvP balance but on "coolness" and fun, but still kind of balanced.  
Heroes Expansion is a mix of the things we enjoy from vanilla H5 and H5.5, spiced with my own creations and edits.  
Have fun !

## Mod Content

### Summary

The main changes compared to vanilla are :
- *2 hero classes per faction : one might and one magic*
- *all hero specializations are more powerful and unique*
- *revamped and unique skill tree*
- *rebalancing of all creatures with a different power curve*
- *reworked and expanded artifacts and sets*
- *and many more little things...*
