### Skill tree

#### Innates skills :

Innates are skills that cannot be unlocked. Either the hero starts with it, or he/she will never have it.  
Every hero has at least one innate perk that depends on its faction. Some hero have explusive innate perks.

- **_STRONGHOLD_ - Voice** : Gain +1 Spellpower every 7/6/5 levels. Consume 10/20/30% less ATB when using warcries.

As you can see Stronghold is a bit special. Barbarians (might class) has Warcries instead of spells, their starting skill is Blood Rage and they can learn the Voice skill. Shamans (magic class) can learn spells, their starting skill is Spiritism and they can transition to Blood Rage through Spiritism at some point, allowing rage bonuses but stopping the ability to learn new spells.

#### About Perks

The tree is very simple : each skill has 2 basic perks, both opening a branch, and all branches have a depth of 3.  
For example let's assume you have some skill at expert level, you can choose between perks A1 and B1 first. Then A1 unlock A2, A2 unlocks A3, B1 unlocks B2 and B2 unlocks B3. So you have 4 possibilities to complete the tree : A1/A2/A3, B1/B2/B3, A1/B1/B2, A1/A2/B1.
It also applies to faction skills.

#### Ultimate perks

Each faction has its ultimate perk. To unlock it, the hero must be at least level 30, have a completed faction skill tree, and have all 6 common skill slots filled (it can be just a basic skill with no perk).

- **_HAVEN_ - Retribution** : Creatures deal 7% additional damages for every positive morale point (capped at 5).
- **_SYLVAN_ - Supernatural Luck** : All attacks are lucky.
- **_FORTRESS_ - Bulwark Rune** : All enemy attacks are unlucky.
