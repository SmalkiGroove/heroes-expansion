# Heroes Expansion

The new Heroes 5 experience !

## Context

This mod was greatly inspired by the work of Magnomagnus and Dredknight on Heroes 5.5.

But this mod is made with a different spirit, it is not focused of perfect PvP balance but on enjoyment, replayability, uniqueness, but still trying to keep it balanced.

Have fun !
