# Heroes Expansion

The ultimate Heroes 5 fun experience !

## Context

This mod was greatly inspired by Heroes 5.5 - thanks to Magnomagnus and Dredknight for their amazing ideas and realization.
BUT... I personally don't enjoy that much playing H55 because most of the fun and unbalanced sh*t has been removed so I decided to change things and eventually made my own mod that keeps fun things from vanilla and from H55. And I tried to implement as much as I could the silly ideas of mine.

## Mod Content

### Summary

The main changes compared to vanilla are :
- 2 hero classes per faction : one might and one magic
- all hero specializations are more powerful and unique
- revamped and unique skill tree
- rebalancing of all creatures with a different tier curve
- reworked and expanded artifacts and sets
- and many more little things...
